Accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) by acquiring fewer measurements has the potential to reduce medical costs, minimize stress to patients and make MR imaging possible in applications where it is currently prohibitively slow or expensive.

fastMRI is a collaborative research project from Facebook AI Research (FAIR) and NYU Langone Health to investigate the use of AI to make MRI scans faster. NYU Langone Health has released fully anonymized knee and brain MRI datasets that can be downloaded from the fastMRI dataset page. Publications associated with the fastMRI project can be found at the end of this README.

This repository contains convenient PyTorch data loaders, subsampling functions, evaluation metrics, and reference implementations of simple baseline methods. It also contains implementations for methods in some of the publications of the fastMRI project.
